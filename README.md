## 1. What is **Ximera XMR1020 main board by Sporniket**, and when to use it ?

**Ximera XMR1020 main board by Sporniket** is an hardware project for a homemade computer coupling a Motorola 68000 CPU (HC version) and a FPGA module that provides display, memory, and some other peripherals.

The XMR1020 is mainly inspired by the Atari ST computer, a computer from the 1985~1995 era ; `1020` is the concatenation of "16" and "32" written in hexadecimal, a nod to "ST" allegedly meaning "Sixteen/Thirty-two", like the width of the databus and the width of internal registers of the Motorola 68000.

This inspiration can be seen with the use of the Motorola Multi Function Peripheral MC68901 chip, the "Mega Bus extension port" that was inside the "Mega ST" variant, and a connector to plug an adaptor to use cartridges made for those computers.

> Motorola was the name of the chip manufacturer at that time. At time of writing (2025), the known IP holder of those obsolete chips is [NXP Semiconductors](https://www.nxp.com/).
